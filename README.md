abstract={Training machine learning models to segment tumors and other anomalies in medical images is an important step for developing diagnostic tools but generally requires manually annotated ground truth segmentations, which necessitates significant time and resources. We aim to develop a pipeline that can be trained using readily accessible binary image-level classification labels, to effectively segment regions of interest without requiring ground truth annotations.},
